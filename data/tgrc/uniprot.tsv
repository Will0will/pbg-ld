"10"	"PG2"	"PG"	"Associated to the cell wall.; Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 28 family.; By ethylene.; Catalytic subunit of the polygalacturonase isozyme 1 and 2 (PG1 and PG2). Acts in concert with the pectinesterase, in the ripening process. Is involved in cell wall metabolism, specifically in polyuronide degradation. The depolymerization and solubilization of cell wall polyuronides mediated by PG2 during ripening seems to be limited by the beta subunit GP1, probably by recruiting PG2 to form PG1.; Contains 4 PbH1 repeats.; Expressed only in ripening fruits (at protein level).; Monomer PG2 (isoenzymes PG2A and PG2B). Also forms heterodimers called polygalacturonase 1 (PG1) with the beta subunit GP1.; N-glycosylated. PG2B isozyme has a greater degree of glycosylation than PG2A.; N-linked (GlcNAc...); Optimum pH is 4.4-4.8 at 35 degrees Celsius. PG1 is resistant to acidic but not to alkaline conditions, at which PG2 is released from the beta subunit.; Optimum temperature is 55-60 degrees Celsius at pH 4.4. PG1 is more thermostable than PG2.; PG1 appears when fruits start to be coloured. When fruits are orange, both PG2 and PG1 are present. In fully ripe fruit, mostly PG2 is expressed.; PbH1 1; PbH1 2; PbH1 3; PbH1 4; Polygalacturonase-2; Proton donor; Random hydrolysis of (1->4)-alpha-D-galactosiduronic linkages in pectate and other galacturonans.; The effect of PG can be neutralized by introducing an antisense PG gene by genetic manipulation.

These values are for PG1.; To avoid liquid rheology of tomato juice, temperature and pressure can be increased to inactivate selectively PG2 during the process."

Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The autoendoproteolytic cleavage occurs by a canonical serine protease mechanism, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain. During this reaction, the Ser that is part of the protease active site of the proenzyme becomes the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, which constitutes an essential element of the active site of the mature decarboxylase.; Phosphatidyl-L-serine = phosphatidylethanolamine + CO(2).; Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase proenzyme 2; Pyruvic acid (Ser); by autocatalysis; Schiff-base intermediate with substrate; via pyruvic acid; for decarboxylase activity; The C2 domains have an essential, but non-catalytic function.
